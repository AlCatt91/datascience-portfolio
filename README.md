# ML and Deep Learning notebooks

A collection of jupyter notebooks about several ML projects. Datasets come mostly from Kaggle (credits in the notebooks).

It is **recommended** to open the notebooks in Google Colab, to correctly display all interactive plots.

1. [NLP - sentiment analysis for Amazon reviews](https://github.com/AlCatt91/datascience-portfolio/blob/main/sentiment_analysis_english_amazon_reviews.ipynb)
> A comparison between classical bag-of-words and DL models (LSTM recurrent neural network and RoBERTa attention-based transformer) to classify the polarity of english Amazon reviews. The accuracy of the best model is over 96%, with consistent precision and recall.

2. [Computer vision - brain tumor detector using ResNet](https://github.com/AlCatt91/datascience-portfolio/blob/main/brain_tumor_detector_with_resnet.ipynb)
> We build a residual neural network which analyzes brain xray scans of patients and detects the presence of brain tumors. Trained on around 5000 images, the model has an accuracy of over 99%.

3. [Credit churn forecast](https://www.kaggle.com/alcatt/credit-churn-model-auc-99-recall-97-acc-96)
> In-depth exploratory data analysis of a dataset of features related to bank customers with a credit card. We compare different tree-based learning models, like Random Forest and XGBoost, and neural networks to build a classifier which predicts whether a customer will churn. The best model has an AUC score of 99% and detects churning customers with a 97% recall.
